    "Wearable data typically takes the form of a time series. One major factor to consider is how to represent time. We can use a human readable format (ex: **Thursday, March 1, 2018 1:42:59 PM** or **3/1/18 13:42:59**) or a timestamp (ex: **1519940579**). We also need to think about timezone - as Participant 1 travels, their timezone changes, which in turn changes their local time. We often represent timezone by storing a GMT offset. Sometimes it makes sense to work with local time and other times we’ll want to work with GMT. [This](https://www.epochconverter.com) is a useful resource that explains and converts between different representations of time. If you scroll down, it also gives code examples in a variety of languages (including Python and R)."
